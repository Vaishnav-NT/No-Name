## Short description

### What's the problem?


### How can technology help?


### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## Demo video


## The architecture


1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description


## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
